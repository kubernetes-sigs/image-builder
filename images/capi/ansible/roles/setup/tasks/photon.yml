  # When the linux package is upgraded on Photon, the current /lib/modules
  # folder is removed, causing future package installs to file if they involve
  # kmods, which a lot of our future packages do. A reboot fixes this. In the
  # future it might be nice to only reboot if that package was upgraded, but
  # a reboot of Photon is generally very fast so this is fine for now.
