# A shallow search in /tmp and /var/tmp is used to declare which files or
# directories will be removed as part of resetting temp space. The reason
# a state absent->directory task isn't used is because Ansible's own data
# directory on the remote host(s) is /tmp/.ansible. Thus, by removing /tmp,
# Ansible can no longer access the remote host.
