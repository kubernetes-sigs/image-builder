- name: Create Azure wireserver access group
  ansible.windows.win_group:
    name: WireServerAccess
    description: Controls access to the Azure WireServer

# AzureGuestAgent and Cloudbase-init need access to wireserver otherwise VM doesn't boot
# So we give the users access via the firewall security filters
# https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/netsecurity/set-netfirewallsecurityfilter
#
# Permissions set on the Firewall rule:
#   S-1-1-0 is Everyone. We mark this as Allow (A) to ensure the Block is enforced for all users other than on the exception list.
#   S-1-5-18 is LocalSystem used by AzureGuestAgent.  We mark this as Deny (D) to add to Block exception list.
#   We also add the newly created group WireServerAccess to the block exception list and add Cloudbase-init user later.
